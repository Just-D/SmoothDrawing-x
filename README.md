# SmoothDrawing-x
Draw smooth lines on Cocos2d-X.

This project is an extension to the excellent tutorial posted at [drawing-smooth-lines-with-cocos2d-ios-inspired-by-paper]
(http://merowing.info/2012/04/drawing-smooth-lines-with-cocos2d-ios-inspired-by-paper) to Cocos2d-x (a cross-platform game
engine framework for mobile). Rather than attempt to divert from the tutorial, it attempts to follow throughoutly in concepts
and theories so that students are able to cross reference both materials (at least it is truth for the moment of writing).

I thought it can be an interesting educational walk-through to demo certain programming concepts adopted in cocos2d-x
framework and the new C++11 to build a platform neutral application, in particular apps inspired by arts.

As always all software projects are considered W-I-P (Works-In-Progress). Please check the Issues link for any known issues
reported so far. I would also be happy to hear from you your advice for best coding practices as I am still learning how to
code properly in the new world.

Cheers!
